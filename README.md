# Password-Encryption

This project has 2 files. The first file is for registering a new user to the system. After the registration it saves the password in encrypted format to a database file.<br />

The other file is for loggin in to the system which takes input for username and passwords and then it checks for a match by decrypting the password corresponding to the entered username.
